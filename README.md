for details.

Run the file `GeneralHeuristic.m` to get a visualisation, given the already fitted parameters.   
Required: MATLAB (v. 9.6 works best).  

Run the file `GeneralHeuristic.m` and its function `fitModel.m` to fit additional data.  
Required: MATLAB (v. 9.6 works best) and Curve Fitting Toolbox (v. 3.5.9).
